This project focuses on predicting user behavior by utilizing a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The process included model training and hyperparameter tuning using the GridSearchCV function, followed by model evaluation and deployment using Gradio.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset

Models Used:
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression
4. Support Vector Classifier
5. Gradient Boosting
6. K-means Classifier

An interesting insight from the dataset is that all features are highly correlated, ranging from 95% to 100%. All models achieved 100% accuracy; however, there was no clear parameter for determining the best model during the evaluation.
